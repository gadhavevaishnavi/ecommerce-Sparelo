                  </h1>
                  <p>
                    The car engine is composed of numerous metal, plastic, and rubber components.
                    Gaskets and sealing rings play a crucial role in maintaining tightness within
                    these mechanisms. They ensure that technical fluids circulating under pressure
                    do not leak, while also preventing dust, moisture, and dirt from entering from
                    the outside.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Gaskets help achieve an ideal fit between surfaces, compensating for irregularities
                    and small defects. Their elasticity allows them to seal the housing and prevent
                    fluid leakage, keeping internal components well-protected.
                  </p>

                      <p>
                        The shape and material of a gasket depend on its function and operating environment:
                      </p>
                      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                        <li>Some gaskets keep technical fluids inside the case.</li>
                        <li>
                          Others provide maximum sealing where parts meet, withstanding high temperatures
                          and internal tension.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Oil seals (a type of gasket) are used where moving and stationary parts meet.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        Each gasket is designed for specific engine types and configurations, meaning
                        they are not interchangeable between different motors. Always purchase gaskets
                        that fit the exact model of your power unit.
                      </p>

                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Gaskets are generally divided into two main types based on their material:
                      </p>
                      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">

                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        Metal gaskets are multi-layered, often made from steel or copper alloys. They
                        offer excellent durability and resistance to wear, though they tend to cost more.
                        Non-metallic gaskets include asbestos-based, asbestos-free, and rubberized
                        varieties — sometimes reinforced with graphite or other materials for improved
                        sealing.
