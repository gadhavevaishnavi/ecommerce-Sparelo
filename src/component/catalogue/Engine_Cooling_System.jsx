                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The cooling system plays a crucial role in maintaining your engine’s
                  temperature, ensuring optimal performance and preventing overheating. It
                  regulates the engine’s thermal balance by removing excess heat generated
                  during combustion. Without a properly functioning cooling system, your
                  engine may deform, oil may lose its protective qualities, and components
                  may wear out prematurely.

                  The most vital part of a liquid engine cooling system is the water pump,
                  which circulates coolant (ethylene glycol-based) around the engine,
                  radiator, thermostat housing, and heater core, ensuring a consistent
                  temperature throughout.
