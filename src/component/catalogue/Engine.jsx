            The car engine parts require regular maintenance to ensure your car
            is running properly. It is not easy to inspect all of them to
            specify the right moment for replacement so that the failure of one
            item will not cause issues with the whole unit. There is a
            maintenance schedule provided in the manual coming with your car.
            Anyway, when there is a need for quality and affordable spare parts,
            go to boodmo — India's largest online marketplace for car spare
            parts.

        {/* About car engine parts */}
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 text-red-600">About Car Engine Parts</h2>
        <p>
         
            There are parts which almost do not show the signs of failure until
            they fail. But if the engine comes out of order, the car will stop
            and need repair. That is why you should be aware of the condition of
            such parts like brake pads, bearings, timing belt kits, rings,
            pistons, valves, and others. The engine parts list is long. When a
            motor has accumulated tons of miles, its components will definitely
            be worn out. They can be damaged as a result of rough driving
            habits.
          
        </p>

        <p>
        
            When you start looking for the problems in your engine, you should
            identify it to find the items corresponding to the auto model. The
            VIN number will be of help. It is usually specified in the car
            registration or at the base of the windshield on the driver's side.
            Knowing the engine, you can start looking for its corresponding
            spare parts to replace the damaged items.
       
        </p>

        {/* Replacement timing */}
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-red-600">
          When Should Car Engine Parts Be Replaced?
        </h3>
        <p>
      
            The engine parts will last depending on their functions. Some of
            them will run for 30,000 miles. Others will require replacement only
            at 90,000 miles of mileage. Under the perfect usage environment, the
            operating time can be longer but it is much easier to start
            considering the condition of your engine since your car has run 30
            thousand miles. Of course, the modern automobiles of the premium
            class are much more reliable. Still, it is important to inspect your
            engine system if:
        
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
              You hear a strange noise which can appear due to a loose mount
              supporting the engine.
          </li>
          <li>           
              You observe constant low oil pressure caused by damaged bearings.         
          </li>
          <li>
            
              You see low power, increased fuel consumption, sludge formation,
              or oil dilution indicating problems with pistons and rings.
            
          </li>
          <li>
            
              It is hard to start and the vehicle runs poorly, which can result
              from issues with the cam drive and timing chain.
            
          </li>
          <li>
            
              There is limited motor potential and low compression caused by
              weak valve springs or valve float.
            
          </li>
        </ul>
