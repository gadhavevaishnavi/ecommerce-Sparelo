                  The clutch system parts are the flywheel, clutch, and pressure plates.
                  When one of the kit is broken, there is no connection between the
                  transmission and motor and that means that a driver will not make a
                  move or if there are some minor issues it will not be able to move
                  properly. Anyway, if you manage to continue driving, you will cause
                  damage to other components including the gear. It is clear that you
                  should replace a damaged item and you can buy the replacement in
                  boodmo - India's largest online marketplace for car spare parts at an
                  affordable price.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">About clutch system parts</h2>
                <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  The key function of the clutch is to transmit engine power to the
                  transmission through the gear box. Thus, the required power reaches
                  the wheels and makes the car ride. When you release the clutch pedal,
                  an auto starts moving under power with the involved clutch. The motor
                  sends the power to the flywheel making it spin which spins the clutch
                  plate and that spins the driven shaft in its turn. This way the wheels
                  get the kick start and begin spinning too. If you press the clutch
                  pedal, you release the clutch plate from the flywheel disconnecting
                  the gearbox from the motor and that leads to smooth slowdown. If every
                  stage of this process is performed correctly, driving is possible
                  without stalling and other confusing reactions.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  All three parts of the clutch take part in this process being pressed
                  together providing the required connection of the transmission and
                  engine. You just cannot do without this unit in the construction
                  because the engine spins all the time, while the transmission does
                  not. Having a worn out or broken clutch, car cannot move because the
                  transmission will not be engaged in driving and stay motionless.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">
                  When should clutch system parts be replaced?
                </h3>
                <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Mostly the clutches are made to continue about 60,000 miles. This is
                  an average performance. There are cars equipped with clutches that are
                  designed to serve over 100,000 miles, which is not common. Experts
                  highly recommend against driving with a damaged clutch, because it is
                  dangerous and causes much more severe damages to the vehicle. There
                  are some signs to understand that there can be issues with your clutch
                  system:
