                  Most drivers will never know what a glow plug is. If your car runs on gasoline, you won't have a glow plug in
                  the engine, but you will have spark plugs. However, if you've come across the term glow plug before, you might be
                  wondering what it means. Similarly, if you drive a car with a diesel engine, you definitely need to know what a
                  glow plug is.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Simply put, a glow plug is a diesel version of a spark plug or even a tiny heater for a diesel engine. It's not
                  exactly the same, but similar. A glow plug is a heating device that makes it easier to start a diesel engine in
                  cold weather. This is because diesel can have trouble starting in cold weather because it is slightly thicker
                  than gasoline. The lower the temperature drops, the harder it is to get diesel fuel moving.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While the spark plug in a traditional gasoline engine literally creates a spark that allows the fuel-air mixture
                  to ignite, a glow plug simply raises the temperature of the diesel fuel and air so that when the mixture is
                  compressed, it can ignite.
                </p>
