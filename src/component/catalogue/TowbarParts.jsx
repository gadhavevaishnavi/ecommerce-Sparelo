                <p>
                  Traveling with a vehicle always carries certain risks — especially when towing a trailer. To ensure
                  your cargo remains safe and to avoid dangerous situations on the road, it’s essential to use a
                  reliable towing device — a <strong>towbar</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The internet is full of towbar parts listings, but finding trustworthy sellers can feel like a game
                  of chance — you might get a quality product or end up with something completely unreliable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Fortunately, not all online stores are risky. At <strong>sparelo</strong>, one of India’s best online
                  auto parts marketplaces, you can find first-class products — both genuine and high-quality analogs.
                  We offer components for every car brand, whether you drive a sedan, SUV, or truck. It’s easy to
                  search by car code, model, or name to find exactly what you need.

                <p>
                  Almost every car owner needs a towbar at some point. Towbars are traction-coupling devices used to
                  connect a trailer to a vehicle — commonly found on SUVs, crossovers, and even passenger cars.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Structurally, a towbar has two main parts:
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Crossbar (beam):</strong> Attached to the vehicle’s frame or body using special holes and
                      fasteners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Tow ball:</strong> Mounted on the beam, it provides the coupling point for the trailer.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                  need to transport construction materials, oversized items, or travel with a trailer and tent,
                  towbars are a practical and secure solution.
