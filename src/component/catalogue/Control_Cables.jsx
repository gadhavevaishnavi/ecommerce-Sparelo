                  <p>
                    Door lock links, also known as door lock rods or door lock actuator cables, are used in the locking system of vehicle doors. They are responsible for transmitting the force from the door lock actuator to the door latch mechanism, allowing for the locking and unlocking of the doors. Door lock links are typically made of steel wire ropes or Bowden cables and work in conjunction with the door lock actuator, which is an electric or mechanical device that controls the locking and unlocking of the doors. When the door lock actuator is activated, it exerts force on the door lock link, which in turn moves the door latch mechanism to lock or unlock the door. Proper adjustment and lubrication of door lock links are essential for reliable door locking and unlocking, ensuring the security and convenience of the vehicle.
