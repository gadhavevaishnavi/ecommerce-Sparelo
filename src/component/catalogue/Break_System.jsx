          <p className="mb-4">
            The car braking system is a classification of mechanical, electronic, and hydraulic components that works
            together with friction for the cleaner stopping of the vehicle. Moreover, it comforts you during bumpy rides.
            When a driver depresses the brake pedal, the pressure moves the piston to the master cylinder, which puts the
            brake fluid from the master cylinder to the wheel cylinders and calipers through brake lines and flexible hoses.
            The modern-day automotive braking system has been refined over 100 years and has become efficient and dependable.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Generally, the braking system in automobiles comprises of disc brakes at the front and disk or drum brakes at
            the rear end, connected by tubes and hoses that link the brake system at each wheel to the master cylinder.
            Other components connected with the braking system includes parking brakes, a power booster, and an anti-lock system.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-red-700">Types of Car Brakes</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">The automotive vehicles usually come equipped with two types of braking systems.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong className="text-blue-700">Disk Brakes:</strong> It is a type of braking system which uses calipers to squeeze pairs of pads
            against a disc in order to create friction. This as a result slows down the shaft rotation including axle, to
            reduce its rotational speed. The energy of motion is converted into waste heat which needs to be dispersed.
            Most of the vehicles these days use hydraulic actuated disc brakes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong className="text-blue-700">Drum Brakes:</strong> It is a type that uses friction caused as a result of shoes or pads that are pressed
            outwards against a cylinder-shaped part called a brake drum. The presently used drum brake kits were first
            invented by Maybach in 1900 and patented by Louis Renault in 1902.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-red-700">Where to buy braking components in India?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The rise of the internet has made it easy for buyers and sellers to come together to get the best deal. In order
            to fulfill that demand, <strong className="text-red-700">sparelo</strong> was incorporated. The company was formed with an aim to bridge
