                  A Meaning of a Car Body and Body Parts of Car
                </h2>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  A car enthusiast can be sure that the motor, transmission or brakes are the most essential
                  components of an automobile. But the car body – the component where all the other
                  components and systems are installed and fixed – still remains the main framework of a
                  vehicle. It locates the driver and passengers, holds the cargo, and protects everything
                  from external impacts.
                </p>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  Exterior is not the least thing to care about. A new automobile attracts attention with
                  flawless lines, curves, and a shiny body surface. A well-maintained car looks elegant and
                  creates a positive impression about its owner.
                </p>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  Yet, dents, scratches, or misaligned doors signal neglect or poor maintenance — sometimes
                  even danger. That's why maintaining and updating your car body is essential.
                </p>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">The main auto body parts include:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5 sm:space-y-2 pl-2 sm:pl-4 text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  <li>A boot lid and a hood</li>
                  <li>Front and rear splashers</li>
                  <li>Body sills</li>
                  <li>Front and rear bumpers and protective accessories</li>
                  <li>Doors, including locks and door handles</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  Additionally, body parts include optics covers, mudguards, spoilers, and protective
                  elements for the gearbox and motor.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-base sm:text-lg font-bold text-red-600">Why Do You Need Car Body Parts?</h2>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">Drivers usually buy body parts for two main purposes:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5 sm:space-y-2 pl-2 sm:pl-4 text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  <li>To repair or replace damaged parts</li>
                  <li>To perform car tuning or modification</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">The most common reasons for replacement include:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5 sm:space-y-2 pl-2 sm:pl-4 text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  <li>Damage from accidents or vandalism</li>
                  <li>Wear and tear due to long-term use</li>
                  <li>High-speed driving on rough roads</li>
                  <li>Improper vehicle handling</li>
                  <li>Poor-quality or unprofessional repairs</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  A skilled mechanic and quality body parts can restore your car perfectly. It's always best
                  to choose original or licensed parts for reliability, though refurbished OEM parts can be a
                  budget-friendly alternative.
                </p>

                <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
                  Tuning allows improving aerodynamics, control, and aesthetics — often using lightweight
                  materials like fiberglass or carbon fiber for spoilers, arches, and ground effects.
                </p>
