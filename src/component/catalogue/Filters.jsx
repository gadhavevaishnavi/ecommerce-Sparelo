                  Filters are the dirtiest parts of the car. They need to be replaced much more often than any other parts.
                  The selection and installation of filters should be treated with special attention, since the "price" of an error
                  can be very high — damage to the engine or the entire fuel system. Installing a quality filter is much more
                  profitable than repairing expensive equipment.

                {/* <!-- List of Filters --> */}
                <p class="font-medium leading-relaxed">
                  In modern cars, with rare exceptions, four filters are installed:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-700 font-medium">
                  <li>Oily filter</li>

                  <li>Air filter</li>
                  <li>Cabin (salon) filter</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="font-medium leading-relaxed">
                  Of course, car designs differ. Some may not have a cabin filter, others have two, and V-type engines have two air filters.
                  The fuel filter is often combined with the pump and installed in the tank.
                </p>

                {/* <!-- Brand Choice Info --> */}
                <p class="font-medium leading-relaxed">
                  There are many manufacturers of car filters, so it is not always easy to make the right choice.
                  To avoid risk, we recommend choosing a proven brand with experience and reliability.

                {/* <!-- Replacement Guidance --> */}
                <p class="font-medium leading-relaxed">
                  For each specific car, the manufacturer sets its own, clearly regulated terms for replacing filters.
                  You can deviate from these recommendations, but only to shorten the interval — never extend it.
                  Exceeding replacement intervals or using low-quality filters can lead to severe damage.
                  Therefore, do not delay replacement — contact <span class="text-red-600 font-semibold">Boodmo</span> today
