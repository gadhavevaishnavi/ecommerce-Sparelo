    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600">About Car Air Suspension</h2>

    <p>
      The air suspension is one of the types of vehicle suspension. It is powered by an electric air pump
      that inflates flexible bellows, disconnecting the chassis from the axle. Some systems use pressurized
      liquid for the same function. This setup ensures a smooth and stable driving experience, supports
      the vehicle’s weight, and absorbs road shocks. Many low-riding trucks use this system to keep the
      wheels even and reduce body roll when turning.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600">
      When Should Car Air Suspension Be Replaced?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The air suspension in cars should generally be replaced between <strong>50,000</strong> and{" "}
      <strong>70,000 miles</strong>, or every 10 years. However, you should check it sooner if you notice
      any issues. Common signs of a failing air suspension include:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
      <li>
        The car begins to sink because the suspension can no longer support its weight, affecting
        performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        The compressor continues running instead of stopping once the desired air pressure is reached.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ride becomes rough and bumpy, with noticeable rolling or leaning during braking or cornering.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you observe any of these signs, seek professional inspection immediately. Replacing worn-out
      suspension components early can prevent more costly damage and ensure safe driving.
