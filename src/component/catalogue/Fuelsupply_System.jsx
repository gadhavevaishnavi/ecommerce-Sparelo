                <p>
                  No car with an internal combustion engine will run if its fuel tank is empty.
                  However, just having fuel in the tank isn’t enough — the <strong>fuel system</strong>
                  is what ensures the proper supply of energy to the engine.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The primary function of the fuel system is to deliver the required amount of fuel
                  to the engine, regardless of operating conditions. Structurally, it’s quite complex
                  as it integrates components from several subsystems. Modern engines use a design
                  that controls injection through a distributor, allowing independent regulation
                  of fuel mixture formation and supply dosing. This optimizes fuel quality and composition,
                  improving power output, reducing toxicity, and minimizing fuel consumption — all managed
                  by an electronic control unit (ECU) using various sensors to monitor speed, temperature,
                  and engine load.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The fuel supply system of any internal combustion engine prepares the fuel-air mixture,
                  consisting of fuel and air in a specific proportion.
                </p>

                <p>The main components of the fuel system include:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                  <li>
                    A tank containing fuel, pipelines, filters, a pressure regulator,
                    and a fuel rail with injectors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Air supply components — idle regulator, throttle mechanisms, and air filter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fuel vapor trap — adsorber with purge valve and connecting pipelines.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Fuel is fed to the carburetor (or injectors, in modern systems), where it mixes with
                  air in the proper ratio. The resulting mixture enters the engine’s cylinders,
                  where it burns to generate power. Exhaust gases are expelled through the manifold
                  and muffler.
