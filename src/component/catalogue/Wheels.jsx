                  The wheel, being an essential part of the chassis, connects the car to the road. Through the wheels,
                  the vehicle achieves motion, transfers vertical loads, and absorbs road vibrations. Additionally,
                  the wheels create traction force when in contact with the road, meaning the car’s drivability and stability
                  depend greatly on them.

                <p>A car wheel consists of two main components:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                  <li>Wheel disc</li>
                  <li>Tires</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The wheel disc serves as the foundation for installing the tire and transferring rotation from the axle.
                  It structurally combines the disc and rim. There are two types of wheel rims — steel and light alloy.
                  In steel wheels, the rim and disc are welded together, while in alloy wheels, both form a single solid unit.
                </p>

                <p>The wheel disc is characterized by the following parameters:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                  <li>Rim width (distance between shelves)</li>
                  <li>Disc diameter (measured at the level of the shelves)</li>
                  <li>Offset (distance from the centerline of the disc to the hub mounting plane)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  The car tire performs critical functions — ensuring grip on the road, providing stability, and supporting
                  the vehicle’s weight. A tubeless tire consists of several components: frame, breaker, tread, sidewall, and bead.
                </p>

                  A car is a complex system of interconnected components. The failure of a single part can lead to damage
                  in related assemblies and degrade the overall vehicle performance.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Remember — there are no unnecessary components in a modern car. Each part serves a purpose.
