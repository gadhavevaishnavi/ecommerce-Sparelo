                  <p>
                    If a timing belt gets ripped, you will hear a loud clap, and the engine will die. 
                    If you try to restart the engine, you will hear metal smashing sounds. This happens 
                    because the connected mechanisms are damaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In diesel engines, the damage can be more severe. The timing belt connects the 
                    crankshaft and camshaft, and if it breaks, the valves and pistons can collide, 
                    causing significant engine damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes, only some teeth are cut out. In this case, the belt will rotate 
                    incorrectly, and the valves will be damaged. This can lead to expensive repairs 
                    or even engine replacement.

                    When changing a car engine belt, you might need additional spare materials depending 
                    on the damage. These may include manifold gaskets, cylinder head, valve caps, and 
                    fastening bolts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the replacement, you will need tools such as a screwdriver, wrench set, and 
                    special installation shafts. It's recommended to find a car elevator or apply to 
                    a service station for the change, as this requires technical expertise.
