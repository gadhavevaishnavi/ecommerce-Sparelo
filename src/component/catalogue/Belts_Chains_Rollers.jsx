                    On cars with internal combustion engines, the crankshaft works in one
                    connection with the camshaft. This is necessary for the timely opening
                    of the intake and exhaust valves with the simultaneous injection of a
                    portion of the fuel mixture into the combustion chambers, the emission
                    of exhaust gases into the exhaust manifold.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-sm">
                    Both shafts are connected by a belt or chain. All elements wear out
                    over time, which causes frictional forces and mechanical loads. To
                    understand when you need to change the timing belt, you need to
                    periodically inspect it. This is done during scheduled technical
                    inspections. And with significant runs, it is better to do them more
                    often.

                  <p className="text-sm">
                    New belts, rollers, chains and tensioners (drive belt, timing belt)
                    must be completely identical to the parts to be replaced.
